# Closed Loop DC Motor Speed Control

A speed control system's goal is to keep the motor's speed constant under a variety of circumstances. The DC motor is a nonlinear device in practice and speed variations are caused by disturbances, changes in load demand, etc. In this projet, the PID controller algorithm, a common controller in industries, has been implemented which overcome the disturbances occurring in the system and establishes the motor speed to the desired value without any human assistance.
